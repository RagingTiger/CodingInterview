Problem Statement:
    In an array of integers, a "peak" is an element which is greater than or
equal to the adjacent integers and a "valley" is an element which is less than
or equal to the adjacent integers. For example, in the array[5,8,6,2,3,4,6],
[8,6] and [5,2] are valleys. Given an array of integers, sort the array into an
alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.
EXAMPLE
Input: [5,3,1,2,3]
Output: [5,1,3,2,3]
Complexity: TODO
Usage:
    peaks_and_valleys -m <input>
    peaks_and_valleys test
