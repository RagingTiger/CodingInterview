Problem Statement:
    In the famous dining philosophers problem, a bunch of philosophers are
sitting around a circular table with one chopstick between each of them. A
philosopher needs both chopsticks to eat, and always picks up the left
chopstick before the right one. A deadlock could potentially occur if all the
philosophers reached for the left chopstick at the same time. Using threads
and locks, implement a simulation of the dining philosophers problem that
prevents deadlocks.
Complexity: TODO
Usage: dining_philosophers
