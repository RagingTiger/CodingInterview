## Description
This repository contains my solutions to the [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://a.co/eflV49b) problems by [Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell](http://www.gayle.com/). They are organized by language and chapter.
Each solution follows a simple format:

```
Author: John D. Anderson
Email: jander43@vols.utk.edu
Problem Statement:
    Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a
    palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards as
    backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome
    does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

    EXAMPLE
    Input:      Tact Coa
    Output:     True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta", etc.)
Complexity: TODO
Usage:
    palindrome_permutation <word>
```

Where author, email, problem statement, and complexity are self explanatory,
and usage is used by the [docopt](http://docopt.org/) library to parse the
arguments and generate a usage message.
