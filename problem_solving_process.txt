# step one
- clarification: make clear and concise bullet pointed notes on the problem
- NOTE: you will likely revisit these notes and edit/add notes during course
  of problem solving
- purpose: this section helps guide your thoughts, and helps you to remain
  clear about what is the problem

# step two
- basic solution: create section for basic solution 
- NOTE: write the most basic solution the problem, and the Big O notation for 
  that solution.
- purpose: basic solution gives you a 'foundation' to BUILD better solutions,
  and also helps verify your understanding of the problem

# step three
- advanced solution: create section for advanced solution that builds on
  the basic solution from '# step two'
- NOTE: typically this will be the hardest part, and as such it will be 
  important to leave a 'bread crumb trail' through your process to keep from
  getting lost. This will likely be added to the 'Notes' section of 
  '# section one.'
- purpose: this is the most difficult part of the process, and will depend
  highly on your master of steps one and two

# step four
- recurse: revist '# step one' and repeat as necessary
- NOTE: this step is usually executed from steps two and three
- purpose: it's important to realize that the problem solving process is
  recursive in nature, and steps 1 - 3 are applied again and again on the
  sub problems within the main problem
