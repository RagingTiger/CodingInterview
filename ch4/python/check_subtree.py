Problem Statement:
    T1 and T2 are two very large binary trees, with T1 much bigger than T2.
Create an algorithm to determine if T2 is a subtree of T1. A tree T2 is a
subtree of T1 if there exists a node N in T1 such that the subtree of N is
identical to T2. That is, if you cut off the tree at node N, the two trees
would be identical.
Complexity: TODO
