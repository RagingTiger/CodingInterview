Problem Statement:
    Given a list of people with their birth and death years, implement a method
to compute the year with the most number of people alive. You may assume that
all people were born between 1900 and 2000 (inclusive). If a person was alive
during any portion of that year, they should be included in that year's count.
For example, person(birth=1908, death=1909) is included in the counts for both
1908 and 1909.
Complexity: TODO
