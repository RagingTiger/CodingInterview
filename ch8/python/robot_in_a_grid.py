Problem Statement:
    Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of a gird with 'r' rows
and 'c' columns. The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but
certain cells are "off limits" such that the robot cannot step on them. Design
an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom
right.
Complexity: TODO
