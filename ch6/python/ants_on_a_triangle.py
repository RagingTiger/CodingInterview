Problem Statement:
    There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle. What is the
probability of collision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking
on the sides of the triangle? Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction,
with either direction being equally likely to be chosen, and that they walk at
the same speed. Similarly, find the probability of collision with N ants on an
N-vertex polygon.
